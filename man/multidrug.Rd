\title{Multidrug Resistence Data}

\description{
This data set contains the expression of 48 known human ABC transporters 
with patterns of drug activity in 60 diverse cancer 
cell lines (the NCI-60) used by the National Cancer Institute to screen 
for anticancer activity.
}

\usage{data(multidrug)}

\format{
A list containing the following components:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{ABC.trans}}{data matrix with 60 rows and 48 columns. 
		The expression of the 48 human ABC transporters.}
    \item{\code{compound}}{data matrix with 60 rows and 1429 columns. 
		The activity of 1429 drugs for the 60 cell lines.}
	\item{\code{comp.name}}{character vector. The names or the NSC No. of the 1429 compounds.}
	\item{\code{cell.line}}{a list containing two character vector components:
		\code{Sample} the names of the 60 cell line which were analysed, and \code{Class} the 
		phenotypes of the 60 cell lines.}
  }
}

\details{
The data come from a pharmacogenomic study (Szakács \emph{et al.}, 2004) in which two 
kinds of measurements acquired on the NCI-60 cancer cell lines are considered:
  \itemize{
    \item the expression of the 48 human ABC transporters measured by real-time quantitative 
	  RT-PCR for each cell line;
    \item the activity of 1429 drugs expressed as \eqn{GI_{50}} which corresponds to the concentration 
	  at which the drug induces \eqn{50\%} inhibition of cellular growth for the cell line tested.
  }

The NCI-60 panel includes cell lines derived from cancers of colorectal (7 cell lines), renal(8), 
ovarian(6), breast(8), prostate(2), lung(9) and central nervous system origin(6), as well as leukemias(6) 
and melanomas(8). It was set up by the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI, one of the U.S. National Institutes of Health) to screen the toxicity of chemical compound repositories.
The expressions of the 48 human ABC transporters is available as a supplement to the paper of Szakács 
\emph{et al.} (2004).

The drug dataset consiste of 118 compounds whose mechanisms of action are putatively classifiable 
(Weinstein \emph{et al.}, 1992) and a larger set of 1400 compounds that have been tested multiple 
times and whose screening data met quality control criteria described elsewhere 
(Scherf \emph{et al.}, 2000). The two were combined to form a joint dataset 
that included 1429 compounds.
