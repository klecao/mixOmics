\title{Liver Toxicity Data}

\description{
This data set contains the expression measure of 3116 
genes and 10 clinical measurements for 64 subjects (rats) that were 
exposed to non-toxic, moderately toxic or severely toxic doses of acetaminophen
in a controlled experiment.

\usage{data(liver.toxicity)}

\format{
A list containing the following components:

    \item{\code{gene}}{data frame with 64 rows and 3116 columns. 
		The expression measure of 3116 genes for the 64 subjects (rats).}
    \item{\code{clinic}}{data frame with 64 rows and 10 columns,

    \item{\code{treatment}}{data frame with 64 rows and 4 columns, 
		containing the treatment information on the 64 subjects, 
		such as doses of acetaminophen and times of necropsies.}
\item{\code{gene.ID}}{data frame with 3116 rows and 2 columns, 
		containing geneBank IDs and gene titles of the annotated genes}

\details{
The data come from a liver toxicity study (Bushel \emph{et al}., 2007) in which
64 male rats of the inbred strain Fisher 344 were exposed to non-toxic (50 or
150 mg/kg), moderately toxic (1500 mg/kg) or severely toxic (2000 mg/kg)
doses of acetaminophen (paracetamol) in a controlled experiment. Necropsies
were performed at 6, 18, 24 and 48 hours after exposure and the mRNA
from the liver was extracted. Ten clinical chemistry measurements of variables
containing markers for liver injury are available for each subject and the
serum enzymes levels are measured numerically. The data were further normalized 
and pre-processed by Bushel \emph{et al}. (2007).
