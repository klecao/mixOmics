\title{Vaccine study Data}

\description{
The data come from a trial evaluating a vaccine based on HIV-1 lipopeptides in HIV-negative volunteers. The vaccine (HIV-1 LIPO-5 ANRS vaccine) contains five HIV-1 amino acid sequences coding for Gag, Pol and Nef proteins.
This data set contains the expression measure of a subset of 2500 genes from purified in vitro stimulated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from 42 repeated samples (12 unique vacicnated participants) 14 weeks after vaccination, , 6 hours after in vitro stimulation by either (1) all the peptides included in the vaccine (LIPO-5), or (2) the Gag peptides included in the vaccine (GAG+) or (3) the Gag peptides not included in the vaccine (GAG-) or (4) without any stimulation (NS).

\usage{data(vac18)}

\format{
A list containing the following components:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{gene}}{data frame with 42 rows and 2500 columns. 
		The expression measure of 2500 genes for the 42 samples (PBMC cells from 12 unique subjects).}
    \item{\code{stimulation}}{is a fctor of 42 elements indicating the type of in vitro simulation for each sample.}
    \item{\code{sample}}{is a vector of 42 elements indicating the unique subjects (for example the value '1' correspond to the first patient PBMC cells). Note that the design of this study is unbalanced.}
        \item{\code{tab.prob.gene}}{is a data frame with 2500 rows and 2 columns, indicating the Illumina probe ID and the gene name of the annotated genes.}

This is a subset of the original study for illustrative purposes.
