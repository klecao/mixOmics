\format{
A list containing the following components:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{gene.exp}}{data matrix with 47 rows and 1753 columns. Each row represents 
      an experimental sample, and each column a single gene.}
	\item{\code{sample}}{a list containing two character vector components:
		\code{name} the name of the samples, and \code{treatment} the treatment status.}

		\code{name} the name of the genes, and \code{description} the description
      of each gene.}

\details{
This data consists of 47 breast cancer samples and 1753 cDNA clones
pre-selected by Pérez-Enciso \emph{et al.} (2003) to draw their Fig. 1.
The authors selected 47 samples for which there was information
at least before or before and after chemotherapy treatment.
There were 20 tumours that were microarrayed both before
and after treatment.
