\title{Nutrimouse Dataset}

\description{
The \code{nutrimouse} dataset contains the expression measure of 120 genes 
potentially involved in nutritional problems and the concentrations of 21 hepatic fatty acids
for forty mice. 
}

\usage{data(nutrimouse)}

\format{
A list containing the following components:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{gene}}{data frame with 40 observations on 120 numerical variables.}
    \item{\code{lipid}}{data frame with 40 observations on 21 numerical variables.}
	\item{\code{diet}}{factor of 5 levels containing 40 labels for the diet factor.}
	\item{\code{genotype}}{factor of 2 levels containing 40 labels for the diet factor.}
  }
}

\details{
The data sets come from a nutrigenomic study in the mouse (Martin \emph{et al.}, 2007) 
in which the effects of five regimens with contrasted fatty acid compositions 
on liver lipids and hepatic gene expression in mice were considered. Two sets of variables 
were acquired on forty mice: 

  \itemize{
    \item gene: expressions of 120 genes measured in liver cells, selected (among about 30,000) 
	  as potentially relevant in the context of the nutrition study. These expressions come from 
	  a nylon macroarray with radioactive labelling;
	
    \item lipid: concentrations (in percentages) of 21 hepatic fatty acids measured by gas chromatography.
  }

Biological units (mice) were cross-classified according to two factors
experimental design (4 replicates):

  \itemize{
    \item Genotype: 2-levels factor, wild-type (WT) and PPAR\eqn{\alpha} -/- (PPAR).

    \item Diet: 5-levels factor. Oils used for experimental diets preparation were corn and colza oils (50/50) for a reference diet (REF), hydrogenated coconut oil for a saturated fatty acid diet (COC), sunflower oil for an Omega6 fatty acid-rich diet (SUN), linseed oil for an Omega3-rich diet (LIN) and corn/colza/enriched fish oils for the FISH diet (43/43/14).
